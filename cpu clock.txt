my current powerplans:
균형 조정 65p 450mhz
인코딩 100p 450mhz
고성능 99p 1050mhz
절전 5p 450mhz

cpu: -50.7812500mV
cache: -50.7812500mV
gpu: -50.7812500mV


fan settings: 55c ~ 85c cpu core 1

do not use balanced gpu!!

this is to prevent current limit throttling!!
:set every current/power limit to MAX
:like 1023.875A/4095.875W

32p 0.8Ghz - lowest & slowest
43p 0.9Ghz - lowest & slowest
50p 1.2Ghz
58p 1.4Ghz
65p 1.6Ghz -> my ideal clockspeed for idle programs
73p 1.8Ghz
84p 2.0Ghz
95p 2.3Ghz -> best for gta5
98p 2.6Ghz
99p 2.7Ghz
100p 3.1Ghz - turboboost

Iris6100 GPU

maximum battery life - 450mhz
balanced - random
maximum performance - 1050mhz, slowly decreases when throttling


create dozens of powerplans for each programs, and easily switch by using some automation tools like process lasso.

for macbooks, use MacsFanControl for windows. set sensor-based value to CPU Core 0(or 1 on newer versions), the most responsive sensor(most responsive sensors are vital for preventing thermal throttling).

starting some idle programs like chrome browser may burst up the cpu clock and in turn burst up fan speed(will make you wet pants). you dont want that. edit the existing idle powerplan you're using to lower the cpu clock. and create other powerplans for programs that really need cpu power.
